# Assembly_on_RaspberryPi
Gonna update my Bits and Pieces of my Assembly Language Code to in Sync

### Why am I doing this?
I have some experince with **Assembly Langauge**. Worked on **Intel 8085** during my University Coursework. I wanted to revisit some of my pervious works and learn something new thereby updating this repo with all the code I learnt and coded. 

Gonna be strict with the comments :)

  System: Raspberry Pi 3b+ 
  
  ## Will keep you all updated!!
